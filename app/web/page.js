            <h3 className='text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-400 pb-8'> ADR Lab is doing amazing things at Michigan and I was lucky to be a part of this amazing team. During my time at the Adel Design Research Lab, I had the privilege of leading the development of a website using Next.js, HTML, and CSS. I oversaw the project from conceptualization to deployment, ensuring the highest standards of performance and user experience. I gained experience in using API's, animations, writing clean code and documenting, collaborating with people with no prior web development experience.</h3>

Death toll was climbing over tens of thousands of people and more were on the streets waiting to be rescued.
